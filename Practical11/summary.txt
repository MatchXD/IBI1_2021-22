I find that:
the alignment score between human DLX5 protein and mouse DLX5 protein is 1490
the percentage of identical amino acids of them is 96.54%
the alignment score between human DLX5 protein and random protein is -351
the percentage of identical amino acids of them is 2.77%
the alignment score between mouse DLX5 protein and random protein is -348
the percentage of identical amino acids of them is 3.11%
So:
the higher the alignment score is and the higher percentage is, the similar the genes are.
The similarity between human and mouse genes is much higher than the similarity between human and random genes or mouse and random genes.
Even though humans and mice are distantly related, there are genetic similarities.
Humans and mice are both mammals and may have shared a common ancestor long ago.
