I find that:
the alignment score between human DLX5 protein and mouse DLX5 protein is 1490
the percentage of identical amino acids of them is 96.54%
the alignment score between human DLX5 protein and random protein is -351
the percentage of identical amino acids of them is 2.77%
the alignment score between mouse DLX5 protein and random protein is -348
the percentage of identical amino acids of them is 3.11%
So:
Even though humans and mice are distantly related, there are genetic similarities
Humans and mice are both mammals and may have shared a common ancestor long ago
