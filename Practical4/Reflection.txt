I'm having trouble with the git push in step 3
After the teacher and students' guidance and answers finally finished the whole practical
I think the practical operation is very suitable for beginners to complete.
It can further strengthen the knowledge and operation of git.
But I still have some questions about what is the difference between git add and git commit.
Why do I have to use these two commands after every modification.
Thank you for your guidance
