the question:
South Korea, Kenya, and Colombia are three countries in different parts of the world,but with similar populations. 
Plot the total number of COVID cases over time in all three.

line number corresponds to where the question is addressed in the covid.py file:
31-47

result:
As we can see in the plot, South Korea had the earliest onset of COVID-19.
The COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea increased sharply from around 2020/2/21 and slowed down a bit by around 2020/3/10.
The Colombian outbreak began around 2020/3/7 and has seen a significant increase in COVID-19 growth around 2020/3/16.
Kenya's COVID-19 outbreak was the latest, first appearing around 2020/3/14. The growth has been more modest.
While the total population of the three countries is similar, the total cases of COVID-19 is very different.
The earlier a country got cases, the worse it went.
